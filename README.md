# Art Gallery with 2D Visualizations on Visitor Trends

## Introduction
This is a Computer Graphics project focused on visualizing visitor trends in an art gallery. The project utilizes OpenGL for rendering, Blender for 3D modeling, and C++ for programming. It was completed by the following team members:

- Shristi Pokhrel (080BCT081)
- Shruti Maharjan (080BCT082)
- Swarnima Khadka (080BCT092)
- Yurisha Bajracharya (080BCT096)

## Libraries Used
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLAD
- C++ Standard Library

## Features
- **Interactive 3D View**: Navigate through the art gallery using keyboard controls.
- **Visitor Trend Visualization**: Visitor trends in the gallery are represented visually in the 3D space.

## How to Run
This project is built using Visual Studio.

1. Open **Visual Studio**.
2. Clone this repository and open the project file.
3. Click **Run** to start the application.
4. Use the following controls to navigate and interact:
   - **Arrow Up/Down**: Move the viewpoint up or down.
   - **W, A, S, D**: Move around the gallery.
   - **Mouse**: Rotate the viewpoint.
5. In case of any linking errors, you may need to build the required libraries yourself. CMake can be used to build and set up the libraries.
